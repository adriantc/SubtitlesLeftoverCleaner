# Subtitles Leftover Cleaner

This project is a small console application designed as a companion for the Plex plug-in [UTF-8 Subtitles Converter](https://github.com/adriantc/UTF-8SubtitlesConverter.bundle).

It cleans up the Plex libraries of the subtitles left after using UTF-8 Subtitles Converter (which generates new UTF-8 encoded subtitle files).

[Current stable version: 1.0.0 (Build 1)](https://github.com/adriantc/subtitlesleftovercleaner)

## Installation

Download the [SubtitlesLeftoverCleaner_x86.exe or SubtitlesLeftoverCleaner_x64.exe from the latest release](https://github.com/adriantc/subtitlesleftovercleaner/releases/latest). Choose the arhitecture you require (x86 or x86-64). If you don't know what that is, choose [SubtitlesLeftoverCleaner_x86.exe](https://github.com/adriantc/subtitlesleftovercleaner/releases/latest).

## Usage

The application must be called with one parameter - the path to the library folder. If you have more then one, run the application once for each folder.

You can use a scheduled task to run it whenever you desire, manually or automatically.
